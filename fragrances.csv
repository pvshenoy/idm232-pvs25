Bee,Eau de Parfum,Zoologist Perfumes,dist/images/bee.png,"The spring day seems still and peaceful. Yet beneath the wildly splattered canvas of a blossom-strewn meadow, thousands engage in a desperate race for survival. Worker bees toil at a frantic pace, ferrying a precious cargo of nectar and pollen to deposit it within cramped honeycomb cells, where it will nurture drones and larvae under the eye of a regal queen. In the claustrophobic hive, a deafening buzz offers evidence of the bees' devotion to duty, not a single worker pausing to question its role in perpetual grind of life in the queendom.

Chameleon,Eau de Parfum,Zoologist Perfumes,dist/images/chameleon.png,"Like the luminescent skin of a reptile, fiery scales of sunlight ripple across the surface of the Indian Ocean, fading slowly to gold and finally sapphire as the sun sinks and disappears. The sea exhales, its gentle tide caressing the beach of an island paradise. The salty breath combines with the narcotic aromas of the ylang and frangipani trees in an intimate kiss, sending shivers through the branches. Something stirs – an eye pivots, a tail grips a slender bough. Will the creature vanish among the leaves, or flirt with a daring display of colour? No one knows.

Cow,Eau de Parfum,Zoologist Perfumes,dist/images/cow.png,"Lush green pastures tumble toward the horizon, arching beneath the imposing silhouette of a mountain range. Cumulus clouds roll across a bright blue sky, their massive shadows gliding over a peacefully grazing herd. In a corner of the meadow, a tiny calf braces quivering limbs and, with a mighty lurch, stumbles up to take its maiden steps. Its velvet snout prods, rooting at its mother, until the release of warm milk signals a satisfying welcome to this vast new world.

Zoologist Cow brings to mind a bucolic scene, a myriad of scents from Mother Nature’s nurturing bosom. Innocent florals sway among soft grasses, while apple gently sweetens the soft aroma of fresh milk. The result is a place both familiar and reassuring, where warm arms unfold to welcome us into a loving embrace. A place called home.",dist/images/notes/apple.png,dist/images/notes/milk.png,dist/images/notes/cedarwood.png
Dangerous Complicity,Eau de Parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange,dist/images/dangerous-complicity.png,"The scent of skin on skin as Inspired by Adam and Eve eating the forbidden fruit, and in doing so, complicity took on another dimension and became dangerous. An aphrodisiac rush of ginger and rum runs through a fleshly apricot cheek and the lost innocence of Jasmine and Osmanthus, warmed by cashmere wood.

Once the aphrodisiac rush of ginger and rum burns through, Dangerous Complicity unveils this passionate pact between fruit, flower and flesh.

This is the scent of skin on skin — or should that be sin on skin? — intimate and sexy, edgy but smooth as a swans-down powder puff. The scent of leather and powder, or rather: the softly scented trace a bad boy’s leather jacket would leave on the powdered skin of a femme fatale. The masculine yielding to the feminine in a fragrant folie à deux - or is it the other way round?",dist/images/notes/jasmine.png,dist/images/notes/rum.png,dist/images/notes/sandalwood.png
Dark Lord,Eau de Parfum,Kilian,dist/images/dark-lord.png,"Dark Lord ""Ex Tenebris Lux' is a gentleman of the night. Meet him in the most surprising of circumstances and his mystery slowly unfolds: A head-twisting mix of shadows and light, it seduces in seconds with its elegant, long-lasting accords of leather and strong vetiver, its jasmine drenched in rum, and a dandyish entrance of bergamot and pepper. Under lock and tasseled key, a 1.7 oz. flacon is carved with the Achilles’ Shield as a symbol of protection and finished with monogram-engraved gunmetal details.

Dodo,Eau de Parfum,Zoologist Perfumes,dist/images/dodo.png,"The sun sparkled across rippling waves, its morning dance upon the Indian Ocean rousing the dodos from their carefree slumber. Stumbling drunkenly across the forest floor they feasted on overripe fruit where it lay, dropped for them by the lush island paradise that nurtured them. For generations, the predator-free and bountiful shores lulled them into such a state of complacency that their wings grew idle, and flight was lost – even to memory. Ultimately evolution would betray them, but while it lasted, the dodos enjoyed an existence marked by ease and comfort.

In Zoologist Dodo, fragrant herbs and ferns are spiked with an invigorating splash of bergamot, juicy pineapple and blackcurrant, before the fruity aroma stumbles into a more traditional fougère. Spices frolic among notes of lavender, tonka and oakmoss, and settle down with beautiful woody undertones of oak. Dodo is a paradox. Like those extinct inhabitants of Mauritius, the scent is at once classic but fun, unknowable but impossibly unforgettable. The ideal perfume for those with an eclectic sensibility who crave a life of leisure and contentment.",dist/images/notes/pink-pepper.png,dist/images/notes/pineapple.png,dist/images/notes/tonka.png
Dragonfly,Eau de Parfum,Zoologist Perfumes,dist/images/dragonfly.png,"Giant lotus pads part to make way for buds that pierce the surface of the jade green pond. They raise their faces to the sun, their delicate fragrance floating around them. In the shadow of the flowers, tiny dragonfly nymphs also emerge from the shallows. They spread their fragile wings and shyly take flight, ready to explore a world beyond the water. Shimmering pools of nearby golden rice fields call to the dragonflies. Their long, quivering bodies flit across the cascading terraces to alight upon swaying stalks, sparkling with sunlight caught in droplets on iridescent wings.

Like a lotus spreading its petals, Zoologist Dragonfly opens with a rush of beautiful aquatic florals. Hints of rice, powdery iris, and mimosa diffuse from within a lush shroud of green, beneath the intimate aroma of an imminent summer shower. Dragonfly encapsulates the richness and romance of impressionism, a canvas of florals under a watery veil.

Koala,Eau de Parfum,Zoologist Perfumes,dist/images/koala.png,"A cloak of rich green velvet sweeps across the Australian horizon, the majestic eucalypt forest flattering every curve of the undulating landscape. Tucked high in the crook of a tree, the koala is oblivious to the mesmerizing views. It would rather curl into a ball and sleep off a feast of oily eucalyptus, the aromatic leaves that sustain it. Despite their sleepy demeanour and friendly expression, koalas are territorial creatures. Males mark the soaring trunks with their musk, establishing their dominance.

Moth,Eau de Parfum,Zoologist Perfumes,dist/images/moth.png,"Their days are spent secluded in camouflage, the intricate pattern of their wings disguising them against a coarse backdrop of barks and rocks. When they finally stir, even their flight is concealed, shrouded beneath the cover of night. Moonlight ripples off a delicate coating of tiny hairs as their feathered antennae guide them in their search for a mate. Only one temptation can lure them from their quest. Should they succumb to the attraction of the flame, their urge to procreate may be quashed in a wisp of smoke and a smattering of ashes.

At first encounter, the rich, gothic scent of Zoologist Moth may surprise but soon it hypnotizes. A heavy dose of dark spices jolts your senses before settling into a dusting of honey-sweet rose and powdery florals. Slowly, it tests its wings, taking flight on an exotic journey of nagarmotha, guaiac wood and patchouli.

Safe in their leafy fortress, the sluggish creatures move so slowly even moss overtakes them. They snooze in a cradle of moist green aromas, oblivious to the chaos below.

Zoologist Sloth captures the tranquility of this sleepy beast in a soothing green essence.

Squid,Eau de Parfum,Zoologist Perfumes,dist/images/squid.png,"The vast ocean swells and contracts, caught in the relentless tug of the moon. Beneath the surface, a school of squid emerges. Strange, elastic forms propel from the deep in a frantic search for sustenance. They are not alone. Their predators lunge, only to be foiled by blinding jets of murky ink. The hunt ends abruptly as a monolith materializes, greedily engulfing all in its path. The massive sperm whale dives, leaving a temporary peace bobbing in its wake. Decades on, relics of the battle resurface. Lumps of ambergris, expelled by the whale and polished by the salty currents, wash ashore. Waste? Flotsam? To the perfumer this elusive substance is nothing less than treasure.
